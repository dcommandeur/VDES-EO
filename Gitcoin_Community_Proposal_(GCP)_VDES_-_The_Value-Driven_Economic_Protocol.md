### **1\. Abstract**

The Value-Driven Economic System (VDES) proposes a novel open-source protocol to address two existential threats: AI-driven unemployment and fiat inflation that erodes basic income. VDES decouples human sustenance from volatile labor and monetary accumulation by introducing:

* A fixed, non-accumulable $3k "Indication Currency" for Universal Basic Needs (UBN), which acts purely as a democratic demand signal.  
* An on-chain "True Cost Ledger (TCL)" that defines cost in transparent, verifiable resource units (Energy, Materials, Labor-Hours), eliminating monetary inflation.

This system creates a Sybil-resistant demand oracle for Public Goods allocation, directly aligning with Gitcoin's 2025 focus on metrics-based funding and progressive decentralization. The initial request funds a 3-month blueprint, economic simulation, and smart contract design phase to enable community builders to finalize and deploy the VDES core protocol.

### **2\. Motivation**

Gitcoin's strategic priorities for 2025 emphasize innovating funding mechanisms and fostering ecosystem resilience. We assert that current public goods funding remains vulnerable to external macroeconomic volatility and the rapidly approaching reality of ubiquitous AI-driven labor automation.

* **The Inflation Problem:** Traditional UBI models are fundamentally unsustainable because the value of the fiat currency they distribute is constantly eroded by centralized monetary policy. This volatility makes long-term resource planning impossible.  
* **The Automation Problem:** Tying human survival to labor income becomes socially catastrophic when AI and automation take over most measurable tasks.

VDES solves this by reframing economics as a "social consensus engine":

* **Fixed Value for Human Sustenance:** The $3k Indication Currency ensures basic needs are met and acts as a pure voting mechanism. Any spending flow is an aggregated "vote" on what the collective community values, providing a clean demand signal for public goods.  
* **Resource Clarity:** The TCL ensures projects are funded based on genuine resource efficiency and sustainability (the true cost), not speculative monetary gain, positioning Gitcoin as the pioneer in AI-resilient coordination.

### **3\. Specification**

#### **3.1 VDES Mechanism Overview**

VDES comprises two interoperable components, designed to create a transparent, decentralized market for value rather than accumulation:

| Component | Function | Funding Signal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Indication Currency ($3k UBN)** | Provides a base level of consumption and acts as a community demand oracle. | Collective spending flows signal which services, arts, and niche innovations have the broadest support (small votes amplified). |
| **True Cost Ledger (TCL)** | A public data schema defining a product’s cost in verified, measurable physical units. | Enables Metrics-Based Retro Funding by prioritizing projects that achieve the highest utility with the lowest verified resource cost. |

#### **3.2 Detailed Mechanics**

**Indication Currency Mechanics:**

* **Fixed Monthly Emission:** $3,000 equivalent allocated per verified unique human (via existing Sybil-resistance methods like Gitcoin Passport/ZK proofs).  
* **Non-Accumulative Design:** Unspent funds Burn-on-non-spend (e.g., revert to a community-governed Public Goods Pool) after 30 days, creating a constant velocity and preventing capital hoarding.  
* **Integration:** Designed as a protocol layer to be easily adoptable by existing UBI platforms (GoodDollar, impactMarket) and L2 public goods ecosystems (Optimism, Arbitrum).

**True Cost Ledger (TCL) Mechanics:**

* **Data Schema:** An open-source JSON/YAML standard tracking mandatory inputs: kWh energy, kg materials (categorized by scarcity/renewability), and verified Human Labor Hours.  
* **Scarcity Multiplier:** The core pricing formula is: $\text{Cost} = \Sigma(\text{Resource Units} \times \text{Scarcity Multiplier})$. The Scarcity Multiplier is adjustable via DAO governance (a new quadratic voting mechanism), allowing the community to democratically decide the social tax on things like carbon emissions or rare earth metal usage.

### **4\. Implementation Plan & Milestones**

The requested 50,000 USDC will fund the foundational open-source research and technical blueprints over 3 months, creating a ready-to-build specification for the wider community.

| Milestone | Deliverable | Budget Allocation | Timeline |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **M1: Economic Modeling & Whitepaper** | Complete VDES Technical White Paper, including the mathematical proof for the non-inflationary nature of the Indication Currency and its relation to velocity/burn. | 15,000 USDC | Month 1 |
| **M2: TCL Schema & Simulator** | Open-source data standard for the TCL (JSON/YAML) and a functional Python/SymPy agent-based simulator to model 1M-user scenarios for inflation/resource-flow resistance. | 15,000 USDC | Month 2 |
| **M3: Protocol Blueprint & Design** | Core smart contract pseudocode (Solidity/Vyper) for the Indication/Burn mechanism, initial UI/UX wireframes, and a formal deployment roadmap (L2/Testnet). | 15,000 USDC | Month 3 |
| **M4: Community Outreach & Documentation** | Creation of detailed technical documentation, README, and a public presentation/defense package to onboard developers and community members. | 5,000 USDC | Ongoing |
| **Total Funding Request:** |  | **50,000 USDC** | **3 Months** |

### **5\. Risks and Mitigations**

| Risk Category | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Technical** | Centralization/Inaccuracy of True Cost Ledger (TCL) Oracles. | Design TCL to accept redundant, multi-source DePIN/ReFi oracle feeds; implement community bounties for oracle auditing. |
| **Adoption/Operational** | Low initial participation in the Indication Currency mechanism. | Target existing highly engaged DAO communities (Optimism, Celo, Impact DAOs) for pilot integration; leverage ZK-proofs for privacy to minimize adoption friction. |
| **Reputational** | VDES being misinterpreted as "anti-capitalist" or "anti-money." | Clear documentation emphasizing VDES as a voluntary, competitive upgrade that unlocks human potential by removing the necessity of survival labor. |

### **6\. Community Impact**

The VDES aligns perfectly with the Gitcoin DAO’s ethos of building new cooperative models and empowering all stakeholders:

* **Builder Empowerment:** The Indication Currency provides the clearest, most democratic demand signal ever created, allowing builders to confidently allocate their scarce time and resources to projects the community actually values.  
* **Decentralization:** By ensuring every individual has the same economic vote, VDES mitigates plutocracy and moves governance beyond Token-Weighted Voting to Human-Weighted Value Signaling.  
* **Sustainability:** The TCL forces transparency, providing a built-in economic incentive for building resource-efficient, low-footprint public goods.

### **7\. Appendix: Economic Simulator Pseudocode Snippet**

(This section provides credibility and a starting point for technical collaborators)

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables for economic proof
N_HUMANS, MONTHLY_INDICATION, RESOURCE_UNITS, SCARCITY_MULT = sp.symbols('N_HUMANS MONTHLY_INDICATION RESOURCE_UNITS SCARCITY_MULT')

# Total demand signal (The $3k Indication)
Total_Demand_Signal = N_HUMANS * MONTHLY_INDICATION

# True Cost Ledger (TCL) Calculation - Simplified Aggregate
Total_True_Cost = sp.Sum(RESOURCE_UNITS * SCARCITY_MULT, (RESOURCE_UNITS, 1, sp.oo)) 

# Monetary Velocity / Stability Proof
# In a non-accumulative system, stability (V) is defined by the constant, fixed demand 
# signal being balanced by the verifiable supply cost.
Stability_Factor = Total_Demand_Signal / Total_True_Cost 

print(f"Total Demand Signal (constant): {Total_Demand_Signal}")
print(f"Stability Factor relies on verifiable inputs: {Stability_Factor}")

# The simulation's core goal is to prove that as N_HUMANS grows, and Total_True_Cost
# is held accountable to real-world inputs, the purchasing power of the $3k remains
# stable against the cost of basic needs—eliminating monetary inflation.
```

### **Call to Action for the Community**

The VDES is a Public Good that must be built openly and collectively. We invite all GTC holders, delegates, and builders to review this proposal, challenge its assumptions, and contribute to the scoping effort.
